             <h2>Challenges</h2>
                <p>We had trouble figuring out how to multiply in the console. Everytime I would try to
                    multiply my array, it would double after every number rather than multiply by 2. We
                then decided to just identify odd numbers. </p>
            
             <h2>Problems</h2>
              <p>We had issues trying to figure out how to do task x. So we decided to leave the code in the 
                console log and then go over it during section. </p>

             <h2>Reflection</h2>
                <p>This was one of the more difficult/frustrating labs I have had to do this quarter. I think 
                    that it was difficult because I haven't had a lot of practice with using mutliplication and 
                addition in javascript. The speed of the class seems to be picking up and I should be making more time
            to practice what we are doing in class. </p>
    
             <h2>Results</h2>
             <p> Go to console to see output!!</p>
