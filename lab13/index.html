                <div id="challenge">
                <p> The point of this lab was to create a loop using conditionals through html and javascript.</p>
            </div>
           
            <h2>Problems</h2>
            <div id="problems">
              <p> I had a problem making the numbers show up on my output. It worked perfectly fine in the console
                log but I could only get fizz, buzz, fizzbuzz, etc to show up on my website page. </p>
            </div>

            <h2>Reflection</h2>
            I think that the concept of this lab was fairly simple and easy to understand. But not having the ability to put the 
            loop on my website really had me questioning my knowledge in javascipt.
