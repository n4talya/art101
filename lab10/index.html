                    <p>The point of this lab was to work with JavaScript and jQuery to create a button that generates randomized text 
                        when it is clicked.  </p>

                  <p> The whole lab went pretty smoothly, I had a bit of an issue getting the button to display words when it was pressed 
                    but I worked with Maya and Vibha to figure out what the issue was. </p>

                    <p> We are finishing up week 7 of this class and I feel pretty proud of how far I've come. I think that coding is pretty 
                        difficult but through the labs, I feel like I've learned a lot.
