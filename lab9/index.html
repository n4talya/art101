                <div id="challenge">
                <p>The goal was to work with a partner to experiment with Jquery and create a button that changes 
                    some aspect of our website. </p>
            </div>
           
            <h2>Problems</h2>
            <div id="problems">
              <p>I had an issue creating my button. At the beginning it would not appear on my screen however, 
                I realized that I had a typo on my html that was preventing it from appearing. I also had 
                trouble making my buttons do things. But I rewatched the lecture video and realized that I 
                had to classify the section and what would change in my js</p>
            </div>

            <h2>Reflection</h2>
            <div id="reflection">
                <p>I was excited but a bit nervous to do this lab because Jquery is a whole new topic that we 
                    have to learn. However, seeing examples and refering back to class lectures really helped 
                me learn how to use jquery to make functional buttons. </p>
