//Two or more player game
//Player 1 comes up with a word or phrase
  //Before the game starts there is a gallow that is made up of 4 lines
  //Player 1 draws a line for every letter in the phrase
//The other player(s) try to guess the word/phrase
  //For every correct letter, Player 1 fills in the letter on top of the line they drew throughout the phrase, even if included multiple times
  //For every incorrect letter, Player 1 writes the letter in the empty top section above the gallow, Player 1 also draws a body part of a stick figure starting with the head
//The other player(s) take turns guessing the letters
//If one of the players is able to guess the word/phrase correctly then they win
  //If the player guesses incorrectly then you draw another body part onto the stick figure
  //Players are able to guess wrong 7 times before they lose
//Once the hangman is completely drawn Player 1 wins
//If the other player(s) are able to solve the word/phrase correctly then they win
