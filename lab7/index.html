             <h2>Challenge</h2>
                <p>The main point of this lab was to work with a partner and learn how to correctly write functions that take user input 
                    and manipulate a string.</p>
            
             <h2>Problems</h2>
              <p>I had trouble linking the javascipt file to my website. I quickly realized that the link name was incorrect and I had 
                to change it in order to get it working properly.</p>

             <h2>Reflection</h2>
                <p>I was a bit worried about this lab because I was feeling a bit confused in class. The class moves pretty quickly so I think that 
                    spending time outside of class to work on this is very important because it is so easy to fall behind. I also had my roommate
                    explain the code in simple terms after class which really helped me in the long run. Overall, I think that this lab was very
                    helpful in understanding functions and string manipulation.  </p>
