                <h2>Challenge</h2>
                <div id="challenge">
                <p>The main goal of this lab was to use Javascript to create a button that will take the users name and
                    create an anagram and replace the text on the screen. </p>
            </div>
           
            <h2>Problems</h2>
            <div id="problems">
              <p> We went over most of the lab during class, but during section I had trouble getting the text that was placed 
                in the button to replace a section of text. When the button would be pressed it would overtake the entire page,
                and I was confused how to prevent that from happening. But I worked on it with my roommate since she is a computer
                science major and she helped explain why that was happening and how to prevent it in the future.

            <h2>Reflection</h2>
            <div id="reflection">
                <p> This lab really helped give me new ideas to present to my partners about our project and how we would go about 
                    pursuing them. Although I had to work through issues in this lab, it really helped me solidify how I would go about 
                    fixing problems in the future and what steps I would take.
