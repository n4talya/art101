                <p> We were tasked to debug any lab we have worked on in the past with the new strategies
                    we learned in class. </p>

            <p>It was nice to go back to old labs and review old issues with new knowledge.</p>

            <p>There was nothing wrong with the code that I had input the first time around, I just wanted 
                to work on lab x because it was the only thing keeping me from getting full credit. I added 
                a phrase to the conditionals in the javascript and now a short blurb is shown once you are 
                sorted into your house.
