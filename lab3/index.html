					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>I had issues getting my photo to resize, I realized that it was the JPG being capitalized in the image folder.
						I also forgot to add the period in front of my CSS which was another factor in the inability to resize the photo.</p>

					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>I got pretty sick this week so it took a little bit to get used to the formatting and understand what was going on. But
						after researching I feel like I sort of have a grasp of what is going on. I still feel like I need more practice 
					making html files.</p>

					<h2>Results</h2>
					<p>Here is the index.html file and structure I made </p>
