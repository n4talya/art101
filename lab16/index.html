    <h2>Challenge</h2>
            <div id="challenge">
             <p>The point of this lab was to experiment with processing JSON from an API </p>
            </div>
           
    <h2>Problems</h2>
         <div id="problems">
        <p> I had issues making the photo show up in the output. When I clicked the button the 
            output would appear in the console log with an error message and I wasn't sure why
            but it turned out that I had failed to change the names I used in lines 33-35. Once I changed
            it to the correct name, the code worked perfectly fine.    </p>
        </div>

    <h2>Reflection</h2>
        <div id="reflection">
        <p> This was a super fun lab and I felt that I handled it really well because we went 
            over it in a good amount of detail during class. </p>
    </div>

    <h2>Output</h2>
        <button id="button">Press Me</button>
        <div id="output"></div>
