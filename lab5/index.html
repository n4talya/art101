					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>Learning how to experiment with javascript data types and variables. </p>
		
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>I couldn't figure out why my javascript wasn't going through and why there was a curly red line
						under a blank space. I worked with my TA to figure out that the quotes and spaces between years
					    and needed to be changed. </p>
			
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>My partner and I worked together during section to make sure that we understood the javascript and how to
						link it in our html. I would say we both put in a good amount of energy and have a thorough understanding of 
						data types and variables. </p>
