            <h2>Challenge</h2>
            <div id="challenge">
             <p>We were tasked to experiement with AJAX and implement it into our website. </p>
            </div>
           
            <h2>Problems</h2>
            <div id="problems">
              <p> Maya and I both had issues getting our output to show on our website. It would appear
                in my console log when the button was pressed, but it would not show up on the actual
             page. So we worked with Vibha and she let us know that the results of this API was in the 
            form of a string. Meaning that we must include result[0].answer in our javascript if we wanted
            it to appear on our webpage. </p>
            </div>

            <h2>Reflection</h2>
            <div id="reflection">
             <p> I think I have a good concept of APIs and AJAX but implementing them is a bit more complicated
                than I thought. I was struggling to figure out why our API wasn't working and it never occured to 
                me that we had to include results with closed brackets since it's an array.  </p>
            </div>

            <h2>Output</h2>
